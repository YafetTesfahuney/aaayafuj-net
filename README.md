1. Project Title and Description
Start with a clear title and a brief description of the project.

# markdown
    # aaayafuj
    **aaayafuj** is an advanced network scanning, vulnerability assessment, and penetration testing tool designed for ethical hackers and 
    cybersecurity professionals. It provides various network reconnaissance techniques and security checks to help identify vulnerabilities 
    in systems and networks.
# 2. Features
* List the core features of aaayafuj. This will help users understand what your tool can do.
# markdown
    ## Features

    - **Host Discovery**: Scan and detect live hosts using ICMP and SYN scans.
    - **Port Scanning**: Supports TCP, UDP, and various stealth scans (SYN, FIN, etc.).
    - **Service and Version Detection**: Banner grabbing and service fingerprinting to detect open services and their versions.
    - **OS Fingerprinting**: Identify operating systems using TCP/IP stack analysis.
    - **Vulnerability Scanning**: Includes vulnerability probes for common services like HTTP, FTP, SSH, etc.
    - **SQL Injection Detection**: Perform automated SQLi tests for web applications.
    - **Firewall Detection**: Test for firewall rules with customized scanning techniques.
    - **Network Mapping**: Visualize network topology and target systems.
    - **Customizable Scanning**: Control scan speed, source ports, timeouts, and specific port ranges.
    - **Exploit Development (Future)**: (Planned) Integration for exploit development and payload generation.
# 3. Installation Instructions
* Provide step-by-step instructions for installing aaayafuj on a system (e.g., Kali Linux). Include dependencies if necessary.
